Up your JS skills with a calculator!

Apprehensive Apprentice Mode

Create a HTML and JavaScript calculator. Your calculator should have:
buttons for numbers 0-9
buttons for each of the 4 basic math operators and remainder/modulo (+, -, /, *, and %)
a button with the equals sign
an output area for displaying the result
For Apprehensive Apprentice mode, you only need to perform math on two single digit integers. You are only expected to display the final result. Make sure that the correct math is being done!
NOTES
Although you may discover it and it may be tempting, you may not use eval() for this project!

FUNCTION BEFORE STYLES!
A styled but non-functional calculator is not ok!
Finish functionality before styling.
Make it work. Then make it better. And if there's still time left, then make it mo' better!

WHAT TO SUBMIT
The repo url (i.e. the Assignment URL) and the pages link (i.e. in the Notes field). (Remember your commit history should tell the story of your development process.)
